Biotechnology PhD with an MEng in Chemical Engineering.

My current work is wet-lab microbiology, in the context of the pharmaceutical industry.
I also help maintain [stack](//haskellstack.org), the Haskell development tool, and write [puzzles](/puzzles) for [BBC Radio 4](//www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qj9z).

In the past I’ve run my college’s [graduate student union](//www.emmamcr.org.uk), constructed cryptic crosswords and written policy papers for [The Wilberforce Society](//thewilberforcesociety.co.uk/).
