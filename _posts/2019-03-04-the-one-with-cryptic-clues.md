This is the *ahem* ‘improved’ version.
The original was broadcast by the BBC, with some accoutrements for Valentine’s day.

# Puzzle

> As a hint, today's puzzle would be called “The One With Cryptic Clues”. On Valentine's Day, there is a blind speed dating event at a coffee shop. Five people walk in: a prophetic Greek deity, a German steed, a Jewish matriarch, a candle maker and the patron saint of wives. Which young animal do they join?

# Solution

Each of the five characters are described using the origins of their forename.

-   Prophetic Greek deity: this is Phoebe, the Titan, the goddess of prophecy.
-   German steed: das Ross is the German for ‘steed’, and the origin of the Ashkenazi name ‘Ross’.
-   Jewish matriarch: Sarah, Rebecca, Leah and Rachel are the four matriarchs of Judaism, and it is the last to whom this clue refers.
-   Patron saint of wives: St. Monica of Hippo (mother of St. Augustine of Hippo). There is some debate as to the etymological origin of the word Monica.
-   Candle maker: Chandler.

These, as any regular Radio 4 listener will know, are five of the six main characters in the NBC sitcom _Friends_.

That means the young animal is a joey.

Bonus points for noting the coffee shop is Central Perk.
